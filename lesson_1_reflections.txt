How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug was introduced?
-> It can detect the exact row line where the difference is done

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-> Cause you can go back to an earlier version if you had an error

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-> Pros, you'll never miss any valuable information that could mess 
-> Cons, You'll have tons of useful files

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-->Cause in coding, in many cases you'll need different files to build a whole solution.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
--> just put it on the command prompt and we can see all the historic and differences between files 1wer
